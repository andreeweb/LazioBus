LazioBus-iOS
====================

**Project closed on 05/08/2016**

The project was developed by a group of students enrolled at the faculty of Computer Engineering at the University of Rome Tor Vergata. The need was to always have all the information you need to plan a trip using public transport. 

The application has been developed for all mobile platforms, iOS, Android and Windos Phone.<br>
This repository contains only the code written by me for the iOS application.

Below are some screenshots:
